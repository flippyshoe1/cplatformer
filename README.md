## cplatformer, the c "platformer" ""engine""
note: this is a hobby project, in doing this to learn and have fun\
do NOT, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, try to run this, unless you wish to help me make this project... work :)

### dependencies (debian based):
```sh
# consider also downloading libsdl2-doc for info
apt install build-essential libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-dev
```
these packages are likely to exist on other distributions as well, but due to different names in\
different package managers, its preferable you refer to the documentation of said distrobution\
as well as the SDL installation guide: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Introduction

### cloning, building and running:
```sh
# to get the repo
apt install git
git clone https://github.com/flippyshoe1/cplatformer.git
